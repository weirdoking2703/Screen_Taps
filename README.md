# Screen_Taps
A simple game made using Flutter
This is a just a simple introduction to libraries like GestureDectector
And how it can be manipulated to obtain the output you needed
I added a Naruto background wallpaper for the entire screen
Its just a one page app
Which just counts the no. of taps
You can have numbers like 143 or 8008 or 80085😂🤣
